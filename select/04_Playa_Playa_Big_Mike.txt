I'm just a playa, playa
I'm just a playa, playa
I'm just a playa, playa
I'm just a playa, playa

What's happening mister big man with all your money and cars?
I see you walking around like you's a motherfucking star
Expensive clothes, high class hoes
Right now you're on top of the world I suppose

Claiming that you're macking but I know that you ain't
The only time you can pull a hoe is when you pulling out your bank
Taking on my wine and my gang and shit
So you can get your dick wet, mister slick

But after all that yo, you still can't keep her
'Cos a nigga likes myself, can come along and sweep her
And have her screaming, "Oh, Big Mike!"
Nigga, you slanging them dollars but you ain't slanging that dick

Why now, you know I fucked your hoe so you run and get your pistol
Madder than a bitch screaming, that I dissed you
But nigga, I ain't diss you, you know the story, Joe
Don't check the motherfucking pimp, check the hoe
(I'm just a playa, playa)

I'm just a playa, playa
I'm just a playa, playa
I'm just a playa, playa

Oh, check it out
Now baby's playing for your money, you're playing her for her drawers
She takes your money, brings it to me, I'm playing both of y'all
Who's the mack, who's the motherfucking pimp?
Who's the motherfucking man and who's the motherfucking simp?

It ain't me 'cos I ain't giving up a penny
Steady fucking her while you be giving up plenty
Now nigga, tell the truth I ain't a dunce
Out of the six times I fucked her, you might have fucked her once

And after you caught a nut, you had to get up prime time
And take her to the nearest store, so she could spend your dough
Every time you fuck her, you got to pay a fee
And oh, yeah, thanks for getting her hair done for me G

It looked good when she came over the other day
Sucking on my dick, all I could see was her hair, anyway
Remember that shirt that she bought you on your birthday
I got two of those and pair of pants and shoes on the first day
(I'm just a playa, playa)
Huh, I'm just a playa, y'all

I'm just a playa, playa
I'm just a playa, playa
I'm just a playa, playa

Now every time you see her, you want to grab her butt
And act like you love her but she don't give a fuck
Don't want to meet your friends, don't want to drive your Benz
Just want to get your ends and then she's gone again, uh

Flipping on a mission with another nigga you know
Even though you try your hardest, you can't figure this so
Seen it before but you still laying down for the tramp
Gave you some pussy, got you sprung and then she just up and vamp

Now tell me what that be like
Brought her some shit to wear [Incomprehensible]
For her hair, she with me, right
Face it nigga, that's the way you made her
The bitch, that she is to day, but me I'm just a playa
(I'm just a playa, playa)

I'm just a playa, playa
I'm just a playa, playa
I'm just a playa, playa

I'm just a playa, playa
I'm just a playa, playa
I'm just a playa, playa

I'm just a playa, playa
I'm just a playa, playa
I'm just a playa, playa
